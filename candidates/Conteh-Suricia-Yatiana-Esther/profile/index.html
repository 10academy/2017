	<p> Hey world, welcome as we go on a journey of my life so far.
Many, many moons back, a beautiful warrior princess was born in the lion mountains of West Africa, Sierra Leone.
She was named Yatiana, Suricia, Esther Conteh, but prefers to be called Yati.
Yati studied English Language and Communiations at Fourah Bay College, University of Sierra Leone.
Graduating with a first class degree, she immediately proceeded to become the first Sierra Leonean to be enrolled
at the 10 Academy fellowship, hosted by Infinite Potentials Consulting in partnership with Ashesi University Ghana. 
This was the start of many, many positive milestones in her life.</p>

<p>Yati is simulated by writing out her thoughts into poems, stories and articles. She is a firm believer that change happens not only when you speak out, but also in its written form as well, i.e the pen is mightier than the sword.
However, there are other things that she is deeply concerned about, like the environment, the protection of animals, 
the eagerness to learn new things, the willingness to share knowledge and 
the love for dogs are the primary driving force of her life.</p>

<p> Yati is a dreamer by nature. She wishes that the world becomes a safe place for all to live. She hopes that love would one day encapsulates everyone's heart. She longs for the day when everyone would be assessed based on their individual outputs and not by their gender, class, religion or social constructions. She aspires to be a change agent in whatever community she finds herself. 
Yatiana is indeed the warrior princess of Sierra Leone. </p>


<p>Connect with her on social media as she realize all these dreams</p>
