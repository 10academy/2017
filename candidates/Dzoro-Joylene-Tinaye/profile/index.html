<h2>Brief history of Joylene</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Joylene was born on a Tuesday, 15 March 1994 in Gutu. She grew up in a small town, Chiredzi which is in the south of Zimbabwe. Joylene has 3 siblings, Miriro, Tinotenda and Ropafadzo. She attended her elementary school at Uncle Jack Pre-school. She did her primar education at Chiredzi Government Primary School. During the holidays, she went to her rural area, Benzi in Zaka where all her relatives are.Joylene can do all the traditional house chores which include sweeping the farm yard, fethcing water at the well, herding cattle and plastering the floor with cow dung. She went to Mashoko High school for her secondary education. There she did her Advanced level and came out with 13 points. Just after her secondary school, she facilitated a grade four class as a temporary teacher in Zaka district.</p>

<h2>Her dreams</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">In her rural community, many children do not have access to primary education because there are very few schools which are located far away fom their areas. A significant number of both girls and boys drop out of school because they fail to endure the long distances. Joylene wishes to make this environment friendly for all children, by coming up with local areas where a group of children can meet and have their classes.</p>
