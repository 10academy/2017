<h1>10 Academy Fellow: Hilja Eelu</h1>
<h3>Namibia</h3>

<p>Aspiring polymath, science enthusiast and advocate for active citizenship; Hilja is
  wholeheartedly committed to the development of Namibia, and Africa as a whole. I am passionate about people and potential and as an avid learner I'm picking up a number of tools to achieve this:

    <p class="id1">Coding with Physically Active Youth (PAY) in Katutura</p>
    <p class="id2"> Video editing as displayed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGbmmo7PezVtPvjWqQnQIGg" target=_blank> here </a> </p>
    <p class="id3">Communications for <a href="http://bym.co.za" target=_blank> Brightest Young Minds </a> </p>

  <p>I love exploring and people have proven themselves fairly interesting, so I keep busy on levels unimaginable.</p>
  <p> I also really like carrot-orange juice. </p>

<h3> In other respects</h3>
<p>I am a 2016 graduate of the BSc Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Cape Town. I am also a Young African Leadership Initiative (YALI) Southern
   African Cohort 7 alumnus and an Allan Gray Orbis Fellow. </p>
  <p> My ambition is to build research and science capacity in Namibia,
  and more importantly an institution to carry out scientific and
  technological research for national development. Fun stuff. </p>
<h3>A selection of quotes that keep me up at night</h3>
<p> "It's tough being human, but I do it anyway" - Hilja Eelu </p>
<p> "There are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis,
  then you've made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis,
  then you've made a discovery" - Enrico Fermi </p>
<p>Honour all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. - 1 Peter 2:17</p>
<p> "I am a believer in the Namibian people: that once we set out to do something,
  there is no doubt we will succeed - no matter what happens" - late Andimba Toivo ya Toivo </p>
