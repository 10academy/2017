		<h2><center>About me</center></h2>
		<p>
		"You are the friend that taught me that its okay to be as open as possible sometimes, with no shame, not just to float on the surface" - Harmony Mahlaba (friend)
		<br>
		<br>
		"Fezile is able to share, take turns and shows profound sensitivity for the needs of others" - Mrs Brodey (Grade 0 Teacher)
		<br>
		<br>
		I picked these opening quotes because I think they best describe my character traits which I am most proud of. Honesty, kindness and emphathy are my personal values which I try to apply to all relationships I have. I am from Swaziland and I possess a great working ethic. 
		<br>
		The songs I have shared below really speak to me as I indentify with them. You can find out more about me on my facebook page using the link below.

			<h2><center>People that have shaped my character</center></h2>
			<p>

			I have been blessed with supportive family members and friends who have helped mould me into the woman I am today. Each intimate encounter with them has challenged me to become a better person. Children are lovely and although they may be young, one can learn a lot from them. Serving in the kids chrurch Ministry for three years was both challenging and rewarding. It helped shape my character as I learnt to be patient, gentle and stern at the same time. I shared so many intimate moments with the children that it warmed my heart and deepened my love for them.

				<h2><center>For the love of nature</center></h2>
				<p>
			
				 Our environment is degrading at an almarming rate due to anthropogenic activities and it is up to this generation to mitigate the effects of humans on the environment so that the future generation can enjoy a healthy environment. My passion for nature and love for children inspired me to study a BSc in Conservation Ecology from the University of Stellenbosch. I want to conserve our ecosystems and promote the sustainable use of natural resources for the future generation to benefit. 
				 <br>
				 <br>
				I am particularly interested in soil conservation which is often ovelooked. Soil supports all terrestrial life on Earth and therefore is vital for the existence of mankind. Some of the food consumed by people and animals comes from plants which gets nutrients from the soil. Healthy soils also absorbs excess water which recharges the water table. They also purify water as it leaches into the ground. I hope through my work, I will get people to appreciate soil as much as I do and encourage soil conservation.
